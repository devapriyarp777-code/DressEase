### Project Description
[An AI powered wardrobe and styling companion that helps us suggest outfits from our actual wardrobe. Automatically pairs outfits based on clothing types, color, mood and occasion and also based on calendar events. ]

### The Problem statement
[Choosing the right outfit daily can be time consuming and confusing. Many people struggle to utilize their full wardrobe efficiently and often end up repeating same combinations. There is a need for intelligent system that can analyze available clothing items and automatically suggests well coordinated outfits. We often by new clothes knowing if they'll match anything we already own,]

### The Solution
[An AI-powered wardrobe management and styling companion that automatically generates coordinated outfits from the user's digital wardrobe. By analyzing clothing type, color compatibility, mood, occasion, and calendar events, the system ensures appropriate and stylish outfit combinations. Users can select or upload garments, and the AI dynamically matches them using predefined pairing rules and color harmony logic, making outfit planning faster, smarter, and more efficient.]

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions


"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
